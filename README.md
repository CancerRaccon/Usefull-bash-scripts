# Usefull-bash-scripts

## Bunch of bash scripts i either written myself or found online. Those written by me will be signed with "SC" 

### install-script
This dude moves a new script to /usr/local/sbin and then makes it executable.

### killprocbyname
All these countless hours of me searching for a PID to kill it are in the past. You know the name? This script is the game.

### myIP
Something to check your what IP's you have.

### ppt2pdf
This will create a .pdf file for every .ppt file within the directory that the command is executed.
Read the doc for this one. After this gets executed use the "killprocbyname" to kill Libreoffice

### refreshui
no need to explain this

### weather
This is a script that i had fuc with for no reason tbh. 
It uses a very popular project by Igor Chubin (https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).
